## What is PHP?

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. It is specially suited for web development.

What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client.

There are three main areas:

1. <b>Sever-side-scripting</b>: Need three things for it to work: the PHP parser(CGI or server module), a web server and a web browser.
2. <b>Cmmand line scripting</b>: Execuded on unix or linux. Ideal for simple tasks auch as text processing.
3. <b>Desktop Application</b>: Not ideal for it but you can create desktop app with a graphical user interface.
